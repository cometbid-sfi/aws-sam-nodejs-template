### Project Folder Structures

**classes:** This folder holds all the class files. In programming, classes are like blueprints for creating objects. So, if you see a file in here, it's probably defining how certain types of things should be structured or behave in your code.

**config:** The config folder is like a control center for your project. It stores configuration settings, like information about your environment and details on how to connect to the database. It's where your code looks when it needs specific information about how it should run.

**dto:** This folder is where we make sure the information coming from users (end-users) is correct and fits our expectations. "DTO" stands for Data Transfer Object, and the files here help validate and structure the data we receive from users.

**functions:** Think of this as the place where the main actions happen. It's like the controller of your project. When your code receives a request (maybe from a user or another part of the system), this folder contains the code that figures out what to do with that request and how to respond.

**interfaces:** Interfaces are like contracts. In this folder, you define what kind of data your code expects to see or work with. If there's a file here, it's probably describing the different types of things your code will deal with.

**services:** This is where the real work gets done. The services folder contains the code that performs specific functions or actions in your application. It's like the engine room of your project, where the actual processes and operations take place.
